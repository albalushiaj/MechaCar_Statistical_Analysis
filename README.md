# ****MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis****
## Overview of Project
- The purpose of this project is to see which variables are able to predict the MPG of a car prototype for MEchaCar company. This analysis provides a written interpretation summary of the findings.
  - Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
  - Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
  - Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
  - Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis.
